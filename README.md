| File Name             | Brief Description |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| `create_dt_set.R`     | Generates datasets from original and engineered sources. |
| `Elastic_Net_Class.R` | Trains and validates the Elastic Net classification model. |
| `funct_Models_.R`     | Auxiliary functions for fitting and evaluating various models. |
| `funct_RND_search.R`  | Implements random hyperparameter search with cross-validation. |
| `hybrid_models.R`     | Integrates regularized models with non-linear algorithms (hybrid models). |
| `Lasso_class.R`       | Trains and evaluates LASSO models for classification tasks. |
| `modelos_bb_class.R`  | Trains black-box models (XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.). |
